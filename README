#################### Check file permissions ###################################
# Make sure that you have permission to read and execute files in this folder
# From myRT folder run these commands in the terminal:
# All the commands in this readme file needs to be run when you're in the main folder (myRT)

pwd

#make sure you are in myRT folder and add read and execute permission to all the files in this folder:

chmod -R 777 *

#or chmod a+rx * -R


#################### Download cdd-pfamA.hmm files ##################################

wget https://omics.sice.indiana.edu/myRT/Models/cdd-pfamA.tar.gz -P Models/

# or curl -L https://omics.sice.indiana.edu/myRT/Models/cdd-pfamA.tar.gz --output Models/cdd-pfamA.tar.gz

tar xvzf Models/cdd-pfamA.tar.gz -C Models/

chmod -R 777 Models/cdd-pfamA/

#or chmod a+rx Models/cdd-pfamA/ -R 

# After Successful uncompress delete the Zip file: rm -f Models/cdd-pfamA.tar.gz

#################### Install FragGeneScan	##################################

# Run these commands

current=$(pwd)
cd bin/FragGeneScan*
make clean
make fgs
cd ${current}


###################### TEST The Executable Files (if needed) #####################
# You can try these commands one by one to make sure all the executable files work

Rscript

bin/pplacer-Linux-v1.1.alpha19/pplacer

bin/FragGeneScan1.31/run_FragGeneScan.pl

bin/blast+/bin/blastp

bin/hmmer3.2/src/hmmscan

#if hmmscan doesn't work, download the latest version of hmmer into bin folder and follow their installation instructions.

#When you install a new version into bin folder, make sure you update the folder name in myRT-local.py too.  

##################### TEST Jplaceparser Rscript #################################

# Then try this command to see if Jplaceparser works 

Rscript Scripts/JplaceParser.R QUERY/CP001312.1/CP001312.1-combo.jplace

# If you already have treeio and castor package, you don't need to install them.
# Please install a package if you get an error that the package wasn't found. 
# If you need to install treeio then use the commands below, and modify Scripts/JplaceParser.R to include --library

mkdir ~/r-packages
R CMD INSTALL --library=~/r-packages bin/treeio_1.14.0.tar.gz
R CMD INSTALL --library=~/r-packages bin/castor_1.6.4.tar.gz

#Then, modify the Scripts/JplaceParser.R use these packagee, for example:

library("treeio",lib.loc="~/r-packages")
library("castor",lib.loc="~/r-packages")

#Then, run this command again

Rscript Scripts/JplaceParser.R QUERY/CP001312.1/CP001312.1-combo.jplace

# You can check myRT.log to see what the output of Jplaceparser looks like
# You should also see these two lines if the jplace file is successfully parsed
#CP001312.1_2157353_2157628_- RVT-CRISPR 0.00 {1248} leaf
#CP001312.1_1357974_1358504_- RVT-CRISPR 0.48 {1312} leaf 

# These two lines show
# RT gene, prediction, confidence, {edgenum}, leaf/non-leaf
# You won't see these lines if you run the pipeline as a whole, the logs will be save in myRT-R.log in myRT folder, and the result of parsing the jplace file 
# will be saved in QUERY/CP001312.1/CP001312.1-pred.txt 
# Please note that these files only exist if phylogenetic information were needed for an accurate prediction, otherwise, these steps will be skipped.

#################### Downloading a reference genome from ncbi ####################
# If all is good then, try this command in the terminal to download this reference genome from ncbi

./Scripts/download_ncbi.sh CP008696.1

# If successful you should have a new folder (CP008696.1) in the QUERY folder

#or

mkdir Newfolder
./Scripts/download_ncbi.sh CP008696.1  Newfolder

# If successful you should have a new folder (CP008696.1) in the Newfolder folder

# If you'd like to download a list of reference genomes prepare a file like list_genomes and run the following command:
# list_genomes should contain one accession number per line. For example, CP008696.1 in line1 and CP001312.1 in line2 with no empty lines,and no space after accession number

# cat list_genomes | while read line ; do ./Scripts/download_ncbi.sh ${line} ; done
  
#################### Run myRT ####################################################
# then run this command

./rerun.sh CP008696.1 QUERY

# Make sure there's no "/" after QUERY
# Check the log file in myRT folder to see what to expect from these two commands

################## Check the output files ########################################
# If the run is successful you should have these two files,along with other files in QUERY/CP008696.1 folder:

ls QUERY/CP008696.1/CP008696.1-gn.gff 

ls QUERY/CP008696.1/CP008696.1-RT.gff 

# You can compare it with QUERY/CP001312.1 folder if you want to make sure you have all the output files
# Also check QUERY/BA000019.2  (For this one the pipeline didn't incorporate the phylogenetic informatic, because hmmscan results were good enough, therefore there is less files in this folder)

#see QUERY/README for a description of output files.
